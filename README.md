# ðŸ§® Quantum Annealing Integer Factorization
Based on the research done in my other repository âœ¨[Quantum Annealing for Prime Factorization](https://github.com/pow4you/IFP_QC)âœ¨ (a fork of [yanarc/IFP_QC](https://github.com/yanarc/IFP_QC)).

This is a proof of concept for a script that can factorize any integer input using a Quantum Annealer.
